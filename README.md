# Simple Developer Hiring Framework for engineering managers
We should always strive to get the best people possible. But it is not always easy. In order to speed things up, we should try to standardize and automatize this process as much as possible. This process should have several stages, depending on the role and your external environment. 

## Stage 1 - Spread the net & grab the attention:
First stage is about attracting as much attention for job posting as possible. First part of this stage includes promoting your job posting to multiple sources.

Second part is to get the attention. The job posting must stand out. Usually, that means captivating text. Ditch the standardized boring job posting full of corporate BS talk and lots of bullet points. That does not work for great programmers nowadays. Also, Flutter is on production grade for about two years or so - meaning we cannot ask for more years of Flutter experience than that. Lets not fall for that 10 years of experience stuff. Years of experience for developers is not the greatest indicator anyways. You can have brilliant out-of-school programming prodigy and on the other side totally stuck non-perspective corporate dev with 10 years of experience.   

### Job description examples:

## Stage 2 - Filter, filter, filter 
So, we grabbed their attention and now we have thousands of CVs in our email which translates into thousands of potential candidates we would have to interview. One hint: We don't want to interview thousands of people.  

We need to quickly filter it according to the things we are deeming important. 

### Filter #1 - CV Filter:
Beyond what we specified as required and secondarily what we specified as bonus, we should be primarily looking on people that have some work beyond their standard professional engagement. It signalize they are really interested in development. These are the people we want. Their own GIT repo with projects, good track on Stack Overflow or opensource contribution. You almost cannot go wrong with people like these.  

### Filter #2 - Automated Programming Test
For Flutter developer tests we will utilize the capabilities of Dart pad which can be embedded on our website and prefilled with some code, guidelines and can include tests. 

### Filter #3 - Take-home Project
Last filter is take-home project that will show us in depth how well can candidate develop a Flutter application. Project cannot be large and must be possible to complete within two days or we can set constant time to finish - a week including weekend. That should be plenty of time even for candidates that are still employed. 

Project should test few key areas that are important for the future work of candidate. In our setting that would be API operations and ability to structure the code according to the architectural patterns we require. 

## Stage 3 - Interview
During interview we need to check few things:
- Inconsistencies between CV and reality
- Inconsistencies in coding skill shown during test and reality
- Theoretical programming knowledge
- Culture fit

As for CV, we should focus on buzzwords and check if they are in CV just for a show or if candidate show genuine interests in the topic. For coding skill, we can ask him about some choices he made during the programming test and programming project. If someone else has done the work, it will be more than possible that candidate will not be able to justify his choices. 

As for theoretical knowledge and Q/A section of the interview, we should use standardized questionnaire that will help us to judge candidates as objectively as possible and that will provide us with some standardized interview score that will we will be able to compare with score of other candidates.
